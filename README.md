Great for roommates, poker nights, fantasy football, or anything else you can think of. Don't struggle to remember, use Get You Later!
The app sets up a tab(like a bar tab) for each of your contacts. If you loan a friend some cash, you put it on their tab.
When your friend pays you back, take it off the tab. Simple.

** Use Get You Later when you:
* - spot a friend cash - make a friendly wager
* - buy tickets for the group
* - 'go in' on a present
* - setup your fantasy football league
* - poker night ...or anything else you can think of!

** Privacy: Get You Later, LLC does not see, collect or store any of your contact information or transaction information.
